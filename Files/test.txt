Not all file systems can record creation and last access times, and not all file systems record them in the same manner. 
For example, the resolution of create time on FAT is 10 milliseconds, while write time has a resolution of 2 seconds and access time has a resolution of 1 day, so it is really the access date. 

The NTFS file system delays updates to the last access time for a file by up to 1 hour after the last access.
